            <p><span class="pe">Professionally Evil</span> is the tag line or motto of Secure Ideas. We are often asked what it means and why we use it. So we built this site to explain.</p>
            
            <p><span class="pe">Professionally Evil</span> is the idea that to understand vulnerabilities and risk, we have to understand how an attacker will use the vulnerabilities in a network or application to attack the organization. This goes beyond simply finding flaws or even exploiting them. It involves understanding the issues and how they can affect the organization.</p>

            <p>Secure Ideas uses the idea of <span class="pe">Professionally Evil</span> in our penetration testing and security consulting. We take the understanding of what attackers are doing today along with how to abuse the systems, to provide our clients with an understanding of what can be done.</p>
